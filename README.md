## Technology
To use CSS Grid in the Nexter project, you would need to first set up the HTML structure of the page. This could include a container element that acts as the parent grid container, and child elements that will be placed in the grid cells.

Once the HTML structure is in place, you can use CSS Grid properties to define the layout of the grid. This could include specifying the number of columns and rows, setting the size of the grid cells, and controlling the placement of the child elements within the grid.
